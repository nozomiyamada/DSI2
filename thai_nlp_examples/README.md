# Thai NLP Examples

- `PyThaiNLP` gives a lot of functions, you just have to use it.
- `BERT` is the strongest tool for various NLP tasks. 
- However, you might be forced to use your own data and build an original model in some tasks, for example


> Supervised Learning (need train data with annotation)

- **Text Classification**
- Named Entity Recognition
- Sequence to Sequence


> Unsupervised Learning

- **Word Embeddings**
- Topic Modelling

Here are the examples of **Text Classification** and **Word Embeddings**.

1. [Text Classification with Logistic Regression](https://github.com/nozomiyamada/DSI2/blob/master/thai_nlp_examples/text_classification_LogReg.ipynb)
2. Text Classification with Fully-Connected Neural Network
3. Text Classification with LSTM + Attention
4. [Word Embeddings of news articles](https://github.com/nozomiyamada/DSI2/blob/master/thai_nlp_examples/word_embedding.ipynb)
