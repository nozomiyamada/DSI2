# Thai NLP Examples

- `PyThaiNLP` gives a lot of functions, you just have to use it.
- `BERT` is the strongest tool for various NLP tasks. 
- However, you might be forced to use your own data and build an original model in some tasks, for example


> Supervised Learning (need train data with annotation)

- **Text Classification**
- Named Entity Recognition
- Sequence to Sequence


> Unsuopervised Learning

- **Word Embeddings**
- Topic Modelling

Here, the examples of **Text Classification** and **Word Embeddings** are given.

1. Text Classification with Logistic Regression
2. Text Classification with Fully-Connected Neural Network
3. Text Classification with LSTM
